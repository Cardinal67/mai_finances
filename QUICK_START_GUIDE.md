# Quick Start Guide - Personal Finance Manager

## üìö What You Have

I've created three documents for your finance management app project:

1. **PROJECT_PLAN.md** - Complete project outline with all features, database schema, and planning details
2. **CLAUDE_BUILD_PROMPT.md** - The actual prompt to give Claude to build your app (COPY THIS!)
3. **QUICK_START_GUIDE.md** - This file (quick reference and next steps)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Before Giving the Prompt to Claude

Answer these quick questions to personalize the app:

#### 1. Hosting Preference
Choose ONE:
- [ ] **VPS Hosting** (DigitalOcean, Linode) - $5-10/month, easiest for "access anywhere"
- [ ] **Home Server** (Raspberry Pi, old PC) - One-time cost, full control, use VPN for remote access
- [ ] **Not sure yet** - Default to VPS, can migrate later

#### 2. Security Preference
For bank account numbers:
- [ ] **Store last 4 digits only** (Safer, recommended for Phase 1)
- [ ] **Store full numbers encrypted** (Convenient but higher risk)
- [ ] **Decide later** (Will default to last 4 only)

#### 3. Safe-to-Spend Defaults
- Look-ahead period: [ ] 7 days  [ ] 14 days  [ ] 30 days ‚Üê Pick one
- Safety buffer: $______ (e.g., $100, $500) or ______% (e.g., 10%)

#### 4. Default Currency
- [ ] USD
- [ ] Other: ________

#### 5. Quick Stats (helps estimate needs)
- Roughly how many bills per month? ______
- How many bank accounts? ______
- Do you often pay bills in installments? [ ] Yes [ ] No
- Do you frequently move money between accounts before paying bills? [ ] Yes [ ] No

## üìã How to Use the Build Prompt

### Step 1: Open CLAUDE_BUILD_PROMPT.md
Open the file `CLAUDE_BUILD_PROMPT.md` in this folder.

### Step 2: Copy the Entire Prompt
Copy everything under the "## THE PROMPT" section (it's very long, that's normal).

### Step 3: Start Fresh Conversation with Claude
- Open a NEW conversation with Claude (don't use this one)
- Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (or latest version)
- Paste the entire prompt

### Step 4: Answer Any Questions
Claude may ask for clarification on:
- Your answers to the questions above
- Specific UI preferences
- Trade-offs between approaches

Just respond naturally with your preferences.

### Step 5: Let Claude Build
Claude will:
- Create all the code files
- Set up the database schema
- Configure Docker
- Write documentation
- Create setup instructions

This will take some time. Let it work through everything.

### Step 6: Review & Test
Once complete:
- Read the README.md Claude creates
- Follow setup instructions
- Test the application
- Report any bugs back to Claude in the same conversation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

### Security
1. **Change all default passwords** in .env file after setup
2. **Use HTTPS** in production (Let's Encrypt - free SSL)
3. **Regular backups** - Set up automated database backups
4. **Keep software updated** - Docker images, OS, etc.
5. **Strong password** for your account (12+ characters)
6. **Don't expose ports** unnecessarily - Use VPN for home hosting

### Self-Hosting Considerations
- **Uptime**: VPS = 99.9%, Home server = depends on your setup
- **Internet**: Need stable connection for remote access
- **Maintenance**: You're responsible for updates and fixes
- **Backups**: Essential - test your backup restore process!
- **Cost**: VPS = ~$5-10/month, Home = electricity + hardware

### What Could Go Wrong (and solutions)
1. **Port 80/443 already in use**: Change ports in docker-compose.yml
2. **Database connection issues**: Check DATABASE_URL in .env
3. **Can't access remotely**: Check firewall, consider VPN instead of port forwarding
4. **Slow performance**: Upgrade VPS plan or optimize database queries
5. **Lost password**: Need to reset via database (instructions should be in README)

## üÜò If You Get Stuck

### During Build Phase
- **Claude gives errors**: Ask it to explain and fix
- **Missing features**: Reference PROJECT_PLAN.md and ask Claude to implement
- **Unclear instructions**: Ask Claude to clarify step-by-step

### During Setup Phase
- **Docker errors**: Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
- **Permission errors**: May need `sudo` on Linux (check README)
- **Port conflicts**: Change ports in docker-compose.yml

### During Use Phase
- **Bug found**: Report back to Claude with specific steps to reproduce
- **Feature request**: Reference PROJECT_PLAN.md phases
- **Data issue**: Check if backups are working!

## üí° Tips for Success

### Starting Out
1. **Start small**: Create 2-3 test bills first
2. **Test partial payments**: Pay one bill in two installments
3. **Set up accounts**: Add your real accounts with real balances
4. **Configure safe-to-spend**: Adjust buffer and time horizon to your preference
5. **Add real data gradually**: Don't try to enter everything at once

### Best Practices
1. **Regular updates**: Record payments as soon as you make them
2. **Check dashboard daily**: Morning routine to see what's coming
3. **Update balances**: Keep account balances current (weekly?)
4. **Attach receipts**: Upload confirmation emails/receipts when possible
5. **Use notes**: Add context for future you ("paid late because...")

### Avoiding Problems
1. **Backup before changes**: If modifying settings, backup first
2. **Don't delete contacts**: Mark inactive instead (keeps history)
3. **Be specific with descriptions**: "Electric - Main House" not just "Electric"
4. **Set realistic buffers**: Don't make safe-to-spend too aggressive
5. **Review missed payments**: Don't ignore red alerts
