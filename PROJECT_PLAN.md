# Personal Finance Manager - Project Plan & Outline

## üéØ Project Overview

**Name:** Personal Finance Manager  
**Type:** Self-hosted web application (accessible from anywhere)  
**User Level:** Complete beginner - needs everything built from scratch  
**Primary Goal:** Track bills, payments, debts, due dates, and maintain financial awareness

---

## üìã Core Problems to Solve

1. **Tracking Chaos**: Lost track of who owes what, to whom, and how much
2. **Due Date Management**: Missing payment deadlines
3. **Account Timing**: Forgetting to transfer money between accounts in advance (accounting for transfer delays)
4. **Payment Complexity**: Handling partial payments, payment plans, multiple payment methods
5. **Financial Visibility**: Not knowing how much money is "safe to spend" vs. reserved for bills
6. **Historical Records**: No organized history of payments to each person/business
7. **Recurring Complexity**: Mix of recurring (various intervals) and one-time payments

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack Recommendations

**Frontend:**
- React.js or Vue.js (modern, component-based)
- Tailwind CSS or Material-UI (clean, professional design)
- React Router (navigation)
- Axios (API calls)
- Chart.js or Recharts (analytics/visualizations)

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express.js OR Python + Flask/FastAPI
- PostgreSQL database (robust, handles complex relationships)
- JWT authentication (secure login)
- Bcrypt (password hashing)
- Node-cron or APScheduler (scheduled tasks for reminders)

**Deployment (Self-hosted):**
- Docker + Docker Compose (easy setup, portable)
- Nginx (reverse proxy)
- Let's Encrypt (free SSL certificates)
- Can run on: Raspberry Pi, home server, VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode)

**Security:**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations & Warnings

### Critical Security Requirements

1. **Data Encryption**
   - ‚úÖ Encrypt routing numbers and full account numbers (AES-256)
   - ‚úÖ Encrypt passwords (bcrypt with salt)
   - ‚úÖ Encrypt sensitive fields at rest in database
   - ‚úÖ Use HTTPS only (SSL/TLS certificates)
   - ‚úÖ Never log sensitive data in plain text

2. **Access Control**
   - ‚úÖ Strong password requirements (min 12 chars, complexity)
   - ‚úÖ Session management with secure cookies
   - ‚úÖ Auto-logout after inactivity (30 minutes)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Two-factor authentication (Phase 2)
   - ‚úÖ Rate limiting on login attempts
   - ‚úÖ Audit logging for sensitive data access

3. **Data Storage**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **OPTION A:** Store full account/routing numbers (encrypted)
     - Pros: Convenient reference, can copy when needed
     - Cons: Higher risk if database breached, compliance concerns
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **OPTION B:** Store last 4 digits only + bank name
     - Pros: Much safer, minimal liability
     - Cons: Need to look up full numbers elsewhere
   - **RECOMMENDATION:** Start with Option B (safer), add Option A in Phase 2 with enhanced security

4. **Backup Security**
   - ‚úÖ Encrypt all backups
   - ‚úÖ Store backups in secure location (not publicly accessible)
   - ‚úÖ Test restore procedures regularly
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Never email or share backups unencrypted

5. **Self-Hosting Risks**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Home network security is critical
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep server software updated (OS, database, application)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Firewall configuration essential
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider VPN access instead of public exposure
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Physical security of server (locked location)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Power backup (UPS) to prevent data corruption

6. **Compliance & Legal**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Storing financial data may have legal implications
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Consult local laws regarding data storage
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider liability insurance if storing sensitive data
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Have a breach response plan
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Document your security practices

### Security Best Practices for Self-Hosting

1. **Use Docker with non-root users**
2. **Regular security updates (automated if possible)**
3. **Strong firewall rules (only expose necessary ports)**
4. **Fail2ban or similar (block repeated failed login attempts)**
5. **Regular automated backups to separate location**
6. **Monitor logs for suspicious activity**
7. **Use environment variables for all secrets (never hardcode)**
8. **Disable directory listing on web server**
9. **Set up HTTPS with Let's Encrypt**
10. **Consider VPN (Tailscale, WireGuard) for remote access**

## üöÄ Deployment Guide (Self-Hosted Options)

### Option 1: Docker + Docker Compose (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- Easy setup and updates
- Portable across systems
- Isolated environment
- Consistent across dev/prod

**What you'll run:**
```
docker-compose up -d
```

**Includes:**
- Frontend container
- Backend container
- PostgreSQL database container
- Nginx reverse proxy container

**Hardware Requirements:**
- 2GB+ RAM
- 20GB+ storage
- Stable internet connection

**Can run on:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB+ RAM)
- Old laptop/desktop
- VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr)
- NAS (Synology, QNAP)

### Option 2: Traditional Installation

**Pros:**
- No Docker knowledge needed
- Direct control

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Harder to update
- System dependencies

### Recommended Hosting Platforms

1. **Home Server (Raspberry Pi / Old PC)**
   - Cost: Hardware only (~$100-$200 one-time)
   - Pros: Full control, no monthly fees, data stays home
   - Cons: Need to manage, power costs, internet dependency
   - Access: Set up Dynamic DNS + Port forwarding OR use VPN

2. **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**
   - Cost: $5-10/month (DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr)
   - Pros: Always online, fast, reliable, easy access from anywhere
   - Cons: Monthly cost, data not physically with you
   - Easiest for beginners wanting "access from anywhere"

3. **NAS Device** (if you already have one)
   - Cost: None (if you already own it)
   - Pros: Already running 24/7, good for backups
   - Cons: May have limited resources

### Remote Access Options

**Option A: Traditional (Port Forwarding + Dynamic DNS)**
- Pros: Direct access
- Cons: Exposes your home IP, security risk
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended for financial data

**Option B: VPN (Tailscale / WireGuard / OpenVPN)**
- Pros: Secure, encrypted, no port forwarding
- Cons: Need VPN client on devices
- ‚úÖ Recommended for home hosting

**Option C: Cloudflare Tunnel**
- Pros: No port forwarding, free, easy setup
- Cons: Relies on Cloudflare service
- ‚úÖ Good option

**Option D: VPS Hosting**
- Pros: Already has public IP, no home network issues
- Cons: Monthly cost
- ‚úÖ Easiest for "access from anywhere"
