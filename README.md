## 🎓 For Complete Beginners

**"I know nothing about web development. Can I still use this?"**

**YES!** This is designed for you. Here's what you need to know:

### What is "self-hosted"?
Your app runs on a computer (yours or a rented one), and you access it through a web browser. Your financial data stays on that computer, not on someone else's servers.

### Do I need coding skills?
**No!** Claude will write all the code. You just need to:
1. Copy a prompt from a file
2. Paste it to Claude
3. Follow the setup instructions Claude provides
4. Use the app in your web browser

### What do I need?
- **Option A (Easiest):** $5-10/month for a VPS (Virtual Private Server) from DigitalOcean, Linode, or similar
- **Option B (Most Control):** A computer that stays on 24/7 (can be a Raspberry Pi, old laptop, etc.)
- A web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- About 30 minutes to set it up

### Is it secure?
Yes! The prompt includes:
- Password encryption
- Sensitive data encryption
- Secure login system
- HTTPS support
- Industry-standard security practices

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before You Start
1. **Read the Quick Start Guide first**
2. **Answer the preference questions** (hosting choice, security settings, etc.)
3. **Have your hosting ready** (VPS account or home server)
4. **Set aside time** (initial setup takes 30-60 minutes)

### After It's Built
1. **Change default passwords immediately**
2. **Set up backups** (test them regularly!)
3. **Use HTTPS** (free SSL certificates available)
4. **Keep it updated** (Docker makes this easy)
5. **Start small** (add a few test bills first)

### Limitations
- **Not a bank** - You manually enter data (until Phase 3 bank integration)
- **Self-managed** - You're responsible for backups and maintenance
- **No automatic bill pay** - You track and record payments manually
- **Single currency** - Primary support for USD (expandable)

---

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### During the Build Process
- If Claude asks questions → Answer them naturally
- If something's unclear → Ask Claude to explain
- If there's an error → Show Claude the error message

### After Deployment
- **Can't access the app?** Check Docker is running: `docker-compose ps`
- **Login not working?** Check your password, or see reset instructions in the README Claude creates
- **Data missing?** Check database container is running
- **Need to reset?** Stop containers, delete volumes, start fresh (backup first!)

### Getting Help
- All technical details are in `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`
- Build specifications are in `CLAUDE_BUILD_PROMPT.md`
- Feature explanations are in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- Ask Claude for clarification on any part
